#nodejs_training_samplesite

***This is for training only, coded while following a tutorial (Node Beginner.pdf)***


**The last version later on, I will create a basic js site, based on this tutorial but from scratch.**

node should already be installed. Google the how-to if you haven't already.
To run, just open cmd or bash and run node with the index.js


 bash$  ***node index.js***

Then access in web browser in:
	http://localhost:8888
