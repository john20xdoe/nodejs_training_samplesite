# nodejs_training_samplesite
example nodejs sample site

*** This is for training only, coded while following a tutorial (Node Beginner.pdf) ***


** The last version later on, I will create a basic js site, based on this tutorial but from scratch. **

node should already be installed.
To run, just open cmd or bash and run node with the index.js


*** node index.js ***

Then access in web browser in:
	http://localhost:8888

In this version, **/start** will be several seconds longer to load compared to **/upload**.
